<h1>Fulmo Talk Series</h1>

<em> Constructed languages—sometimes called "conlangs"—are intentionally designed languages, created with specific goals in mind. Esperanto, the most well-known among them, was developed in the late 19th century to foster international understanding by being easy to learn and culturally neutral. Unlike natural languages that evolve over centuries, Esperanto was built to be logical, consistent, and accessible—reportedly taking just a few months to learn to conversational fluency.

At Fulmo, we believe that such languages offer not only a tool for communication but also a lens through which to reimagine what global understanding might look like. While Esperanto succeeds in reducing many of the irregularities and complications found in natural languages, there’s still room to experiment with even more streamlined, inclusive, or expressive systems. Language is both a bridge and a blueprint, and constructed languages remind us that it can be redesigned—just like technology or architecture.

The Fulmo Talk Series, conducted in association with the Esperanto and ConLang Society of South India, presents the talks below as part of its effort to create more awareness about Esperanto and other Constructed Languages like Esperanto. Through talks like these, we aim to inspire curiosity about how we communicate and how our tools—linguistic and technological—shape the way we think, live, and connect. Whether you're a linguist, technologist, or simply curious about the future of human expression, the Fulmo Talk Series invites you to explore these intersections with us.</em>

Let me level with you.

I have always ‚Äî always ‚Äî been *oh so disappointed* with the look of blogs.

Not just my blog. Blogs, in general. Even the well-behaved ones. They either try too hard ("Look, I have parallax scrolling and five kinds of breadcrumbs!") or they don‚Äôt try at all ("Here‚Äôs my 2011 WordArt header, deal with it.").

And then there‚Äôs this one.

**Delfik Orakle.**

It doesn‚Äôt try. It doesn't even pretend to try.

I‚Äôve tweaked things here and there over the years. Moved widgets. Changed background colors. Accidentally broke things. Added a search bar that no one uses, including me.

Once, in a fit of ambition, I spent two hours trying to fix everything using templates. I even was once so ambitious that I tried to fix the header on Blogger.

I failed.

The header remains *defiantly off-center* ‚Äî a quiet metaphor for my entire aesthetic life.

Let me be honest:  
I‚Äôve been tempted.  
Oh yes, I‚Äôve stood at the gates of WordPress, hand on the mouse, seduced by the clean templates and customizable blocks. I‚Äôve whispered:

> "One day, I will migrate this whole mess over."

But then reality taps me on the shoulder and says:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been using Blogger since before Instagram was even born. Who are you kidding?‚Äù

You see, moving all this content would take‚Ä¶ **effort**.  
And frankly, I‚Äôd rather spend that effort writing about how much I dislike my own blog layout.

So I stay.  
I blog.  
I squint.  
I accept.

This, dear reader, is **Blogger**.  
Not a platform. A state of being. A commitment to inertia.  
A digital filing cabinet in the cloud with a post-it note that says ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt judge me by the fonts.‚Äù

And yes ‚Äî I know it looks ugly.

But you know what?  
Sometimes ugly grows on you.  
But not in this case.

I continue to create beautiful websites.  
Like the one I created for the La Gxoja Filozofio project.  
People said it looked very nice. Almost everyone compliment me about it. Yes, that one.

But, yes, sometimes, ugly grows on you.  
Like lichen.  
Or existentialism.  
Or the word **"moist."**

So on delfikorakle.blogspot.com, I remain ‚Äî typing into the void, under fluorescent serif fonts and widgets from the Paleozoic era ‚Äî because this was my home.

Still mine.

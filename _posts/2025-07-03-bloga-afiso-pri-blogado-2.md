Let me level with you.

I have always — always — been *oh so disappointed* with the look of blogs.

Not just my blog. Blogs, in general. Even the well-behaved ones. They either try too hard ("Look, I have parallax scrolling and five kinds of breadcrumbs!") or they don’t try at all ("Here’s my 2011 WordArt header, deal with it.").

And then there’s this one.

**Delfik Orakle.**

It doesn’t try. It doesn't even pretend to try.

I’ve tweaked things here and there over the years. Moved widgets. Changed background colors. Accidentally broke things. Added a search bar that no one uses, including me.

Once, in a fit of ambition, I spent two hours trying to fix everything using templates. I even was once so ambitious that I tried to fix the header on Blogger.

I failed.

The header remains *defiantly off-center* — a quiet metaphor for my entire aesthetic life.

Let me be honest:  
I’ve been tempted.  
Oh yes, I’ve stood at the gates of WordPress, hand on the mouse, seduced by the clean templates and customizable blocks. I’ve whispered:

> "One day, I will migrate this whole mess over."

But then reality taps me on the shoulder and says:  
“You’ve been using Blogger since before Instagram was even born. Who are you kidding?”

You see, moving all this content would take… **effort**.  
And frankly, I’d rather spend that effort writing about how much I dislike my own blog layout.

So I stay.  
I blog.  
I squint.  
I accept.

This, dear reader, is **Blogger**.  
Not a platform. A state of being. A commitment to inertia.  
A digital filing cabinet in the cloud with a post-it note that says “please don’t judge me by the fonts.”

And yes — I know it looks ugly.

But you know what?  
Sometimes ugly grows on you.  
But not in this case.

I continue to create beautiful websites.  
Like [this one I created for the La Gxoja Filozofio project](#).  
People said it looked very nice. Almost everyone compliment me about it. Yes, this one.

But, yes, sometimes, ugly grows on you.  
Like lichen.  
Or existentialism.  
Or the word **"moist."**

So here I remain — typing into the void, under fluorescent serif fonts and widgets from the Paleozoic era — because this is my home.

**Welcome back to Delfik Orakle:**  
Still deconstructed.  
Still mildly embarrassing.  
Still mine.

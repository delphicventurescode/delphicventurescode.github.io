In a world weighed down by deadlines, disappointment, and the endless scroll of content, we at Delphic Ventures are pleased to introduce something different. Something quieter. Something rooted in resilience.

🌿 **La Gxoja Filozofio** — The Philosophy of Joy.

This is not a productivity hack or a shiny new framework. It’s a way of being. A reorientation of thought that invites joy not as an outcome, but as a practice. As a presence.

I’ve been developing *La Gxoja* over time, drawing from personal experience, philosophical reflection, and a desire to reclaim meaning in the everyday. Think of it as a set of guiding practices for people who are tired — not of living, but of pretending.

We launched a site to share this project in more depth. You can explore it here:

👉 [Visit the La Gxoja Filozofio website](https://lagxojafilozofio.wordpress.com/)  

This blog — on GitHub — will serve as a living companion to that project. 

If you’ve ever felt that quiet voice inside you say, *“There must be another way to be,”* — you’re not alone. *La Gxoja* is for you.

Welcome.

– Anand

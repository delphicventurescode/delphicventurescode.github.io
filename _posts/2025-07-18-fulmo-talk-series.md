Good news, everyone.

Some of the talks from the **Fulmo Talk Series** have officially made their way to **YouTube**, which means they're now immortalized in pixels, compression artifacts, and overly aggressive thumbnail suggestions.

## âœ¨ What is Fulmo?

For those new here: Fulmo Games Hub is our attempt to recreate the magic of spontaneous joy, one short game at a time. And now, we even have talks. Short ones, mind you. No droning lectures. No 57-slide decks. Just 7â€“10 minutes of distilled thoughts, odd metaphors, and the occasional microphone mishap.

You might laugh. You might cry. You might even pause the video halfway through to Google "semiotics of lightning bolts."

## ðŸŽ¥ Where do I watch?

Right here, friend:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Fulmo Talk Series on YouTube](https://delphicventurescode.github.io/talks/)

Subscribe if you like talks that are short, smart, and often slightly surreal.  
Or donâ€™t. But then how will you know when we upload the one where someone talks about thermodynamics *and* emotional baggage?

## ðŸ¤” Why YouTube?

Because printing out QR codes and stapling them to trees wasn't scaling.

Also: Itâ€™s free, global, and the algorithm once recommended me a tutorial on medieval breadmaking after I watched a talk on AI ethics, soâ€¦ clearly, it's working.

## ðŸ“Œ Stay Tuned

Weâ€™ll be uploading more talks over the coming weeks. If youâ€™ve given a talk, or plan to give one, your moment in algorithmic glory may be just around the corner.

In the meantime, grab a cup of tea (or La Gxojaâ„¢-branded elderflower soda) and enjoy the ride.

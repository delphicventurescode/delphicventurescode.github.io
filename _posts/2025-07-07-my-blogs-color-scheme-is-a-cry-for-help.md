Can we talk about the color scheme?

I don’t know how it happened. I vaguely recall setting “something-or-the-other” as the background in 2011. Might have been beige. That beige has since evolved — nay, mutated — into something resembling sunburnt cardboard. The font color is somewhere between “dusty regret” and “accidental plum.”

It’s not even ironic.

People visit my blog and squint. Not at the ideas — at the contrast.  
It’s like trying to read poetry carved into an overripe avocado.

I tried fixing it once.  
I clicked into Blogger’s Advanced Theme Editor and was immediately offered 400 customizable settings, all helpfully labeled things like:

- Widget Border Hover  
- Outer Sidebar Link Glow  
- Footer Divider Top Shadow Horizontal (?)  

I panicked. Again.  
Changed nothing.  
Closed tab.  
Ate chocolate.

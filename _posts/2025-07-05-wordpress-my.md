I visited WordPress again earlier this week.  
Just… browsed. No touching.

There was a theme called... never mind what it was called. It had white space, graceful typography, and a font pairing that whispered calming affirmations to my soul. More than all of that, it had *soul*.

I stared at it the way one might stare at a minimalist Scandinavian chair one cannot afford.

I clicked **“Live Preview.”**

For a moment, I imagined a parallel universe:  
One where *Delfik Orakle* wore clean margins and tasteful shadows.  
One where my blog looked like it drank green tea and meditated daily.  
One where my hyperlinks were centered and emotionally balanced.

But then I looked at my export options and saw:

**“Download XML backup file”**

Cue dramatic music.  
I panicked. I closed the tab. I opened Blogger again like a digital comfort blanket. Yes, it was ugly. Yes, the layout was from 2008. But it was *my* layout from 2008.

We’ve been through too much together.

# 🐾 Poetry for Dogs? Oh yes, we went there.

**Have you ever heard of Poetry for Dogs?**  
Well, now you have.

At **Fulmo**, we believe creativity isn't just for humans — dogs deserve verse too. That’s why we launched **Hunda Poezio** — a series dedicated to generating poetry for dogs. We even have code to generate such verse in **iambic pentameter**.

Whether you're a **coder**, a **canine**, or just **curious**, there’s something here for you.

## 📦 What's in the box?

We currently have **more than one GitHub repo** exploring the idea of dog-centric poetry. In fact, we even have a project going on related to generating books of **haiku poetry**. More than **fifteen books of haiku** poetry have been written — and some of the poems are for dogs.

Some haikus focus on **South Asia** — themed around monuments in India.

Others are on **Hawaii**. We even offer **free, open-source code** to generate verse automatically — yes, even iambic pentameter, barked out ten syllables at a time.

You can find the poetry books on Amazon and Flipkart. Want to buy a poetry book right now? Just search for "Anand Manikutty poetry" on Amazon. A few clicks and a book of poetry will be headed to your home. Yes, this is also from "the fertile imagination of Anand Manikutty", as someone at Fulmo called it.

## 🧠 How does it work?

Using tools like the **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary** and simple **stress pattern analysis**, we can construct grammatically correct and metrically valid lines that follow classic poetic forms.  

It's silly. It's serious.  
It's very possibly the future.

## 🐶 Want to play?

Whether you want to **fork the code**, train your dog to recognize sonnets, or just chuckle at the absurdity of it all, you’re warmly welcome.

## Bloga Afiŝo Pri Blogado 1: I Blog, Therefore I Cringe  
**Or: A Reflektado on Serif Fonts**

Let’s get this out of the way:

I’ve been blogging since the Jurassic era of the internet. Back when dinosaurs roamed Orkut, and *Yahoo! Answers* was considered a valid form of intellectual debate.

My delfikorakle.blogspot.com blog?  
It predates Instagram, Pinterest, and whatever new productivity app the cool kids are shilling this week.

But let’s face it.

**My old blog?**  

**My DelfikOrakle blog?**  
It’s... *ugly*.  
There. I said it.

Tbh, it isn’t even really a blog anymore.  
It’s just a mess of content waiting to be inhaled by some future A.I. model with impeccable taste and no judgment.

And when I look at all the beautiful websites I’ve made since — clean, elegant, thoughtfully styled — I come back here and… I weep.  
*Metaphorically*, of course. 🙂  
One simply doesn’t weep quite as much when armed with the tools and techniques of **La Gxoja Filozofio**.

### Why is my old blog ugly?

- The fonts are confused.  
- The color scheme looks like it was chosen by candlelight during a thunderstorm.  
- And the layout? Let’s call it *"retrospective minimalist with a dash of disappointment."*

And yet — I keep posting.

Because it is **Delfik Orakle**:  
My noble, deconstructed, semi-haunted mess of a blog.  
A stubborn relic of the past, held together with hyperlinks and misplaced idealism.

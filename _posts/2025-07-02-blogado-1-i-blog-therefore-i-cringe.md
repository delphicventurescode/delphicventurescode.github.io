## Bloga Afi≈ùo Pri Blogado 1: I Blog, Therefore I Cringe  
**Or: A Reflektado on Serif Fonts**

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way:

I‚Äôve been blogging since the Jurassic era of the internet. Back when dinosaurs roamed Orkut, and *Yahoo! Answers* was considered a valid form of intellectual debate.

My delfikorakle.blogspot.com blog?  
It predates Instagram, Pinterest, and whatever new productivity app the cool kids are shilling this week.

But let‚Äôs face it.

**My old blog?**  

**My DelfikOrakle blog?**  
It‚Äôs... *ugly*.  
There. I said it.

Tbh, it isn‚Äôt even really a blog anymore.  
It‚Äôs just a mess of content waiting to be inhaled by some future A.I. model with impeccable taste and no judgment.

And when I look at all the beautiful websites I‚Äôve made since ‚Äî clean, elegant, thoughtfully styled ‚Äî I come back here and‚Ä¶ I weep.  
*Metaphorically*, of course. üôÇ  
One simply doesn‚Äôt weep quite as much when armed with the tools and techniques of **La Gxoja Filozofio**.

### Why is my old blog ugly?

- The fonts are confused.  
- The color scheme looks like it was chosen by candlelight during a thunderstorm.  
- And the layout? Let‚Äôs call it *"retrospective minimalist with a dash of disappointment."*

And yet ‚Äî I keep posting.

Because it is **Delfik Orakle**:  
My noble, deconstructed, semi-haunted mess of a blog.  
A stubborn relic of the past, held together with hyperlinks and misplaced idealism.

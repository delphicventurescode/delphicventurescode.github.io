Let’s talk widgets. I once had an idea for a new blog style. I worked on it for a little bit. I came up with something.

The sidebar included:

- A blogroll with links to writers who haven’t posted since 2013.
- A broken image that once proudly said “Subscribe to my RSS feed.”
- A hit counter that I think is still working, but I haven’t clicked on it in fear it may bite.
- A quote box that autoloads a single aphorism: “Be yourself; everyone else is taken.” Very 2009. Possibly Oscar Wilde. Possibly my high school teacher. Who knows?

Then, I came right back to the DelfikOrakle blog.

Hosted at, you might remember, the following URL: http://www.delfikorakle.blogspot.com/

I’ve considered cleaning it up.

But then I think: *isn’t this history?*  
More than 20 years of history, in fact.
Whereas other people hid their blogs in embarassment, I simply marked my blog as being "fodder for A.I.". And moved on!
What is DelfikOrakle?
A digital dig site?  
Future archaeologists will stumble across **Delfik Orakle** and say,  
“Ah yes, a pre-Instagramian info-hoarder. Fascinating.”

I’ve grown fond of the mess.  
The widgets are like fossils.  
**Ugly, irrelevant fossils.**  
But still fossils.

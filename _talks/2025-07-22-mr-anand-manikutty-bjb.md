In this talk, Mr. Anand Manikutty talks about the Esperanto language.

As part of the Fulmo Talk Series, we featured Prof. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a leading researcher in the field of Happiness Studies. We were honored to also feature Mr. Anand Manikutty, an accomplished researcher in computer science and strategic management. Strategic management researchers are also interested in productivity and mental well-being, and thereby, the question of what organizational strategy should be. 

A multi-faceted technology professional, writer, inventor and former engineer, Mr. Manikutty introduces Esperanto, the *Internacia Lingvo* (or "International Language"). He also shares his creation of a new constructed language called **Hesperanto**, designed to address specific challenges in language learning and cultural inclusivity. A central idea in Hesperanto is the concept of **aayaato** — the intentional borrowing of words across languages. This feature of Hesperanto is designed to significantly speed up language acquisition and improve learner engagement.

Developing a whole new ConLang like that is quite *mirinda* (trans.: "wonderful"), and we are really excited about the futuristic possibilities such a language opens up.

Constructed languages—sometimes called "conlangs"—are intentionally designed languages, created with specific goals in mind. Esperanto, the most well-known among them, was developed in the late 19th century to foster international understanding by being easy to learn and culturally neutral. Unlike natural languages that evolve over centuries, Esperanto was built to be logical, consistent, and accessible—reportedly taking just a few months to learn to conversational fluency.

At Fulmo, we believe that such languages offer not only a tool for communication but also a lens through which to reimagine what global understanding might look like. While Esperanto succeeds in reducing many of the irregularities and complications found in natural languages, there’s still room to experiment with even more streamlined, inclusive, or expressive systems. Language is both a bridge and a blueprint, and constructed languages remind us that it can be redesigned—just like technology or architecture.

Through talks like this one, we aim to inspire curiosity about how we communicate and how our tools—linguistic and technological—shape the way we think, live, and connect. Whether you're a linguist, technologist, or simply curious about the future of human expression, the Fulmo Games Hub (https://www.fulmo.live), the Fulmo Talk Series, the La Gxoja Projekto and the La Gxoja Filozofio initiative (https://lagxojafilozofio.wordpress.com) invite you to explore these intersections with us.

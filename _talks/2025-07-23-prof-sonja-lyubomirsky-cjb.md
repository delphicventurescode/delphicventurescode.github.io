Prof. Sonja Lyubomirsky introduces herself with a little preview of her impressive background.

Constructed languagesâ€”sometimes called "conlangs"â€”are intentionally designed languages, created with specific goals in mind. Esperanto, the most well-known among them, was developed in the late 19th century to foster international understanding by being easy to learn and culturally neutral. Unlike natural languages that evolve over centuries, Esperanto was built to be logical, consistent, and accessibleâ€”reportedly taking just a few months to learn to conversational fluency.

At Fulmo, we believe that such languages offer not only a tool for communication but also a lens through which to reimagine what global understanding might look like. While Esperanto succeeds in reducing many of the irregularities and complications found in natural languages, thereâ€™s still room to experiment with even more streamlined, inclusive, or expressive systems. Language is both a bridge and a blueprint, and constructed languages remind us that it can be redesignedâ€”just like technology or architecture.

Through talks like this one, we aim to inspire curiosity about how we communicate and how our toolsâ€”linguistic and technologicalâ€”shape the way we think, live, and connect. Whether you're a linguist, technologist, or simply curious about the future of human expression, the Fulmo Games Hub (https://www.fulmo.live), the Fulmo Talk Series, the La Gxoja Projekto and the La Gxoja Filozofio initiative (https://lagxojafilozofio.wordpress.com) invite you to explore these intersections with us.

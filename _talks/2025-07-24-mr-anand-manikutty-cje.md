In this sobering and historically grounded talk, delivered in two parts, we revisit the horrors of the Holocaust—widely regarded as one of humanity’s darkest chapters—and draw parallels with a lesser-known but long-standing pattern of violence: the Hindua-Genocidaro. The term, coined in the constructed language Sansperanto, refers to a centuries-long series of genocides against Hindus, spanning invasions, forced conversions, massacres, and erasures. Drawing on mainstream history and the research of François Gautier, this talk explores how memory, language, and truth-telling are essential to healing civilizational wounds.

Sansperanto, a conlang that blends Sanskrit and Esperanto, was specifically developed to facilitate conversations around historical Hindu suffering while offering linguistic safety and neutrality. It includes built-in rules—such as the avoidance of politically charged terms—that allow for respectful discourse without entanglement in ideology. The talk advocates for a new cultural and academic vocabulary to discuss Hindu trauma with the same moral clarity afforded to other genocides. And, besides all this, there is more. There is even a new framework for understanding history called La Gxoja Historia. Kaj eĉ oni diskutas pri nova lingvo. (Trans. : "And there is even a new language being discussed.")

This talk is part of the Fulmo Talk Series, an initiative to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and greater awareness of Esperanto and other constructed languages.

Constructed languages—sometimes called "conlangs"—are intentionally designed languages, created with specific goals in mind. Esperanto, the most well-known among them, was developed in the late 19th century to foster international understanding by being easy to learn and culturally neutral. Unlike natural languages that evolve over centuries, Esperanto was built to be logical, consistent, and accessible—reportedly taking just a few months to learn to conversational fluency.

At Fulmo, we believe that such languages offer not only a tool for communication but also a lens through which to reimagine what global understanding might look like. While Esperanto succeeds in reducing many of the irregularities and complications found in natural languages, there’s still room to experiment with even more streamlined, inclusive, or expressive systems. Language is both a bridge and a blueprint, and constructed languages remind us that it can be redesigned—just like technology or architecture.

Through talks like this one, we aim to inspire curiosity about how we communicate and how our tools—linguistic and technological—shape the way we think, live, and connect. Whether you're a linguist, technologist, or simply curious about the future of human expression, the Fulmo Games Hub (https://www.fulmo.live), the Fulmo Talk Series, the La Gxoja Projekto and the La Gxoja Filozofio initiative (https://lagxojafilozofio.wordpress.com) invite you to explore these intersections with us.
